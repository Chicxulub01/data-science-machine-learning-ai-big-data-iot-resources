# Product Development Methodologies

## Product Management Key Elements and Phases
- Product vision
    + The needs addressed, problems solve, and the WHY
- Product strategy
    + Plan to achieve product vision and goals
    + Manifested as the roadmap
        * Identify and state needs and alignment with vision
        * Use scenario-based planning
        * Consist of releases
        * Should always be dynamic and fluid, and expectations/communications managed as such
    + Outcome-driven innovation (ODI) and JTBD
        * Customers don't buy products and services; they hire various solutions at various times to get a wide array of jobs done.
        * Investment themes are designed to be addressed on "a percentage of resources to be made available basis." Not in the backlog.
            - Along with epics help with prioritization and determining roadmaps
- Product design and definition
    + UX/UI
    + Information architecture
    + Interaction design
    + Conceptual design
    + Requirements
    + Acceptance criteria
    + Epics, user stories, tasks
    + Backlog artifacts
- Product delivery

## Considerations and Tradeoffs
- Iron triangle
    + No silver bullet for magically delivering fixed scope by a fixed date with fixed resources, requires difficult business­based trade­off decisions
- Design by committee (collaboration vs concensus)
    + Godin - "Nothing is what happens when everyone has to agree"
    + Consistently produces weak results

## Agile Values
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation                    
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

## Agile Manifesto

## Prioritization
- JTBD and importance vs satisfaction | underserved needs
    + Opportunity (top left)
    + Competitive market (top right)
    + Not worth going after (bottom half)
- Kano model
    + Categories
        * Must have
        * Performance
        * Delighter
    + Notes
        * Today's must have is tomorrow's delighter
- Pareto: which 20% of features deliver 80% of value/impact
- CoD/CoS (class of service) framework
- MoSCoW ­ "MUST, SHOULD, COULD, WON'T"
- Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) ­ Value Divided by Effort
- Buy a feature
- KJ method, affinity diagramming/grouping
    + Brainstorm on sticky notes
    + Group items together and name the groups
    + Vote on or rank the groups
- Scorecarding
- Weighted shortest job first (WSJF)
    + Priority = Cost of delay / Job duration
    + Jobs that deliver the highest value (i.e., cost of delay) and can be implemented in the shortest duration are of the highest priority for implementation

## Kanban
- Principles
    + Visualize workflow
    + Create flow and pull
    + Balance demand against throughput
    + Limit WIP
    + Target lead time with performance metric
    + Continuous improvement
    + Class of service
- Benefits
    + Flow-driven, pull system, balance demand and throuput
        + Allows for 'just in time' and more focused delivery of work
        + Less multitasking and context switching
        + Reduces wasted time (parkinsons as well)
    + Not everything requires estimates and deadlines
    + Front-loading not optimimal, and oftern arbitrary
    + Matches client request of weekly meetings
    + Continuous improvement and reprioritization, not fixed methodology
    + More flexible process-wise and with client, which we need now
        + Quickly adapt to new information and needs
    + Emphasized continous delivery
    + Increased productivity and efficiency
        + Increased output

## Lean 
- Principles
    + Build, measure, learn
    + Fail fast
    + Maximize customer value while minimizing waste
    + Create flow and establish pull
    + Minimum marketable feature
    + Minimum viable product
    + Minimum lovable product

## Risk Management
- ROAM model
    - Resolved:­ the risk has been answered and avoided or eliminated
    - Owned: the risk has been allocated to someone who has responsibility for doing something about it
    - Accepted: the risk has been accepted and it has been agreed that
        nothing will be done about it
    - Mitigated:­ action has been taken so the risk has been mitigated,
        either reducing the likelihood or reducing the impact
- Key risks
    - Value risk: would anyone buy this or choose to use it?
    - Usability risk: would they be able to figure out how to use it?
    - Feasibility risk: can our engineers build this with the technology
        available, the time available, and the skill­sets available on the team?
    - Stakeholder risk: are the different parts of the company ok with this proposed solution?
